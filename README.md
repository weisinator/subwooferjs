# subwooferjs
The goal of this project is an open source javascript subwoofer library to be included in other open source projects.

If you want to see the package in action, it is a core part of a node/express/pug stack at [Subwoofer Tools](https://www.subwoofer.tools)
# v1.0.3 updates
The driver object can now create subwoofer objects for a maximally flat ported or sealed subwoofer, as well as an "extended bass shelf" ported subwoofer alignment, good for smaller drivers with a higher resonant frequency.
# v1.0.2 updates
Updated dependencies to fix vulnerabilities.
# v1.0.1 updates
Rounded numbers off to keep things simple.
