# subwooferjs
The goal of this project is an open source javascript subwoofer library to be included in other open source projects.

If you want to see this package in action, take a look at my website at [Subwoofer Tools](https://www.subwoofer.tools), where this package serves as a core component in a nodejs/express/pug stack.
